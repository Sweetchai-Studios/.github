# Welcome to **sweetchai.codes** 🍵✨

Hey! I’m a computer science student and digital creator, working on cozy, aesthetic, and functional tools to brighten your day and boost your productivity ✨  
This is my little space where I share side projects — from handy apps to workspace goodies — all built to help both myself and others stay inspired and organised, while growing my skills beyond textbooks and coding drills.

Stay tuned for some exciting projects in the works! 🚀
