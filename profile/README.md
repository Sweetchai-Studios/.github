Hi, I'm Tayyeba,
I've got a load of ideas brewing up and need a place to put them all to share with you!

Here you'll find open-source projects focused on wellness, sustainability, and meaningful design â€” all created with a user-first mindset and a touch of aesthetic calm.

## ðŸŒ± Featured Project: Glow [coming soon]
Glow is a nature-inspired wellness assistant app designed to support your self-care journey. With a soothing interface, customizable routines, and eco-conscious goals, Aloe helps you feel good, do good, and stay grounded.

> "Feel good, is good, does good."
